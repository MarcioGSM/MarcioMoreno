# Observability Engineer, Delivering Real-Time Insights for Uninterrupted Service Availability

## What I Bring to the Table

My career has been a deliberate progression from the fundamentals of system stability to the architecture of complex monitoring ecosystems.

**As a System Analyst**, I built a deep understanding of what it takes to keep core infrastructure running—from RHEL and Windows Server administration to implementing automated backups and proactive monitoring with Zabbix. This foundation taught me the value of **resilience** and **proactivity**.

**As a Monitoring Architect**, I moved beyond implementation to design, sizing, and integration. I led projects to replace proprietary tools with distributed Zabbix systems, ensuring seamless integration with third-party tools. This experience instilled a focus on **scalability** and **architectural excellence**.

**As an IT Consultant**, I apply this expertise directly to client success, focusing on service availability and quality. I translate business requirements into customized monitoring solutions, leveraging data from APIs and databases to create real-time, actionable insights. This is where **client-focus** and **technical mastery** converge.

I bring a unique blend of hands-on administration, architectural design, and consulting experience to ensure your services are not just monitored, but truly observable.
